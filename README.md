# Smart Office AIOT

Smart Office AIOT is a Flutter application for managing factory modules and displaying production information. The project uses **GetX** for routing, dependency injection and state management. It targets mobile and desktop platforms and provides a bilingual user experience with support for dark and light themes.

## Project structure

```
lib/
  config/      - application constants and color styles
  data/        - static demo data models
  generated/   - localization code generated by `flutter_intl`
  lang/        - language controller and selection screen
  model/       - data models
  screen/      - UI screens (login, home, settings, splash, ...)
  util/        - helper utilities such as biometric authentication
  widget/      - reusable widgets
```

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK **3.7** or higher
- Dart SDK matching the Flutter version
- Android Studio / Xcode or other tools for device emulation
- Git for cloning the repository

## Environment variables

Add Flutter and Android tools to your path (replace the paths with your own):

```bash
export FLUTTER_HOME=<PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK>
export PATH="$PATH:$FLUTTER_HOME/bin"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=<PATH_TO_ANDROID_SDK>
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools"
```

The authentication endpoint is defined in
`lib/config/auth_config.dart`. Edit `baseUrl`, `clientId` and
`clientSecret` if your environment uses different values.

Run `flutter doctor` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Setup and run

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_org/smart_office_aiot.git
   cd smart_office_aiot
   flutter pub get
   ```
2. (Optional) generate application icons:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run icons_launcher:create
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Switching languages

On first launch or from **Settings -> Language**, choose your preferred language. The app currently supports English (`en`), Vietnamese (`vi`) and Chinese (`zh`). The selection is stored locally using `GetStorage` and will be applied on the next launch.

## Key features

- Login screen with optional FaceID / fingerprint authentication
- Dark and light theme toggle
- Home dashboard listing modules and subprojects
- Image viewing and download support
- Localized UI with three languages

## Testing

Run the Flutter test suite with:

```bash
flutter test
```
